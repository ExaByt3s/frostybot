Changelog:
==========

0.1 :   Initial version
0.2 :   Code cleanup
        Removed the FLIPLONG and FLIPSHORT commands. Incorporated into LONGENTRY and SHORTENTRY.
        Added POSITION command to show current position
        Added size parameter
0.3 :   Added ORDERS and CANCEL command to show open orders and cancel orders (limit orders)
        Added price parameter (limit orders)
        Changed output of BALANCE, TRADES and POSITION commands to JSON
        Changed IP whitelist to const to prevent skull fuckery
0.4 :   Added size parameter support for % of balance (ie. 200pct = 2x)
        Added TAKEPROFIT command with size parameter as % of open order (ie. 50pct)
0.5 :   Named changed to Frostybot so I don't get sued

0.6 :   - ccxt installation via an install.sh script (and cleanup of 750 mb of unneeded files)
        - now bot is usable with testnet or alternate api endpoint urls (base api url is now configurable for exchange)
        - support bitmexico
        - flag to turn bot on and off
        - separate configs per exchange bot, with core functionality in lib extracted so we can have
            multiple bots without code dupes
        - allow for space separated command (same syntax as command line) in POST body. This enables:
            - simpler syntax for users in the alert message box of tradingview
            - allow pinescript to setup the commands (preconfigure a bot)
            - let the user override the command by editing the message box instead of a webhook url
            - webhook url can then just simply point to the bot without querystring which is a bit cleaner
        - support % besides pct for percentages which is convenient in POST and command line like 'long 50%'
        - changed api.
                -- replaced --
                        LONGENTRY, LONGEXIT, SHORTENTRY, SHORTEXIT, TAKEPROFIT
                -- with --
                        LONG, SHORT, CLOSE
                -- where --
                        CLOSE is replacing LONGEXIT, SHORTEXIT and TAKEPROFIT
                        CLOSE works the same as LONG / SHORT with percentages or absolute sizes.
        - support for max position (enter multiple longs in a row wont blow you up)
        - auto adjust order size in case the max limit is reached. Say max position is 100% of your account and
            you're 50% long. Adding a 'long 100%' would in theory be 150% account size. This last order
            is auto adjusted to 50% so we end up at the maximum position size (which we wanted).
        - changed api examples to use lower case (easier to type :-))
        - early exit with more descriptive warnings in case of typo's or wrong parameters.
        - placed readme and changelog in separate files
        - added usd balance to log
        - introduced many bugs, uglified the code :-)

0.7 :   - skipped cause changelog not in sync with version numbers (0.6 was distributed as 0.7, whoops)

0.8 :   - refactor directory/file structure. added lib / config directories and fixed install script for that.
            - renamed folders and use <exchange>/<pair> structure which is more scalable.
            - currency pairs should now be easy to add in the future.
            - bot configs are smaller as exchange anomalies are solved in the code.
            - separated output functions into output.php
            - this means that the url structure also changes. see INSTALLATION anf README
        -  removed install.sh from the distro. not needed anymore because we include ccxt in the distro
           for easier setup. licence is included and is MIT, so no issues.
        - added support for ETH on Deribit and Bitmex
        - removed hardcoded local ip, added global config for adding your local ip to the whitelist
        - added exchange configs so you don't have to repeatedly put your keys in for each currency pair
            - support main accounts in exchange.config.php (default)
            - can be overridden per bot subaccount in the <currency_pair>/config.php (recommended)
        - made main.php more generic. Removed all hardcoded refs to BTC.
        - added INSTALLATION guide with hopefully easy steps the get going
        - log file restructuring, placed outside the public www dir (was security issue)
        - added command 'log' to show the contents of the log file,
            - by default shows last 10 lines,
            - you can give the number of lines as a parameter
        - added 'summary' command. gives an overview for currency pair:
            - balance
            - position
            - orders
        - added many comments to make it easier for users to configure the bot
        - add exchange errors to the log (in raw format)
